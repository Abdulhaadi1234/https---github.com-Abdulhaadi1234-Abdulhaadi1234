            <h2>Robert Downey jr</h2>
            <p>Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor. His films as a leading actor have grossed over $14
            billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. Downey's career has been characterized by
            some early success, a period of drug-related problems and run-ins with the law, and a surge in popular and commercial
            success since the late 2000s.[2] In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in
            the world. From 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.
            
            At the age of five, Downey made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s 1970 film Pound. He subsequently
            worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). Downey's portrayal of
            Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic Chaplin received him a BAFTA Award and his first Academy Award nomination for Best
            Actor. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series
            Ally McBeal in 2000 and won a Golden Globe Award for the role. Downey was fired from the show in 2001 in the wake of
            additional drug charges. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.
            
            Downey made his acting comeback in the 2003 film The Singing Detective, after Mel Gibson paid his insurance bond because
            completion bond companies would not insure him.[3] He went on to star in the black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005),
            the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008), the latter which earned him an Academy Award
            nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Downey gained global recognition for starring as Iron Man in ten Marvel Cinematic
            Universe (MCU) films, from Iron Man (2008) to Avengers: Endgame (2019). He has also played Sherlock Holmes in Guy
            Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and in its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game
            of Shadows (2011).
            
            Downey has also taken on dramatic parts in The Judge (2014) and Oppenheimer (2023), winning an Academy Award, a Golden
            Globe, and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in the latter. For playing
            multiple characters in the black comedy miniseries The Sympathizer (2024), he received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy
            Award. He made his Broadway debut in 2024, playing Jacob McNeal in Ayad Akhtar's McNeal.</p>

            <h3>iron man</h3>
            <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor
            Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first
            appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.
            Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor,
            Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently
            since the character's creation.
            
            Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons
            manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he
            built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight,
            energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to
            create a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to explore political themes, with early
            Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and
            Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest,
            technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.
            
            Major Iron Man stories include "Demon in a Bottle" (1979), "Armor Wars" (1987–1988), "Extremis" (2005), and "Iron Man
            2020" (2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide stories Civil War (2006–2007), Dark Reign (2008–2009),
            and Civil War II (2016). Additional superhero characters have emerged from Iron Man's supporting cast, including James
            Rhodes as War Machine and Riri Williams as Ironheart, as well as reformed villains, Natasha Romanova as Black Widow and
            Clint Barton as Hawkeye. Iron Man's list of enemies includes his archenemy, the Mandarin, various supervillains of
            communist origin, and many of Stark's business rivals.
            
            Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008), the first film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and
            continued to portray the character until his final appearance in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Downey's portrayal
            popularized the character, elevating Iron Man into one of Marvel's most recognizable superheroes. Other adaptations of
            the character appear in animated direct-to-video films, television series, and video games.</p>
