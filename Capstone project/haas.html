        <h1>Haas</h1>
        <img src=""
        <p>Haas Formula LLC,[8] competing as MoneyGram Haas F1 Team,[9][10] is an American-licensed[11] Formula One racing team
        established by NASCAR Cup Series team owner Gene Haas in April 2014. The team made its debut in the 2016 season.[12] The
        team principal is Ayao Komatsu, who replaced Guenther Steiner who served in the role from the team's inception until
        January 2024.
        
        The team is headquartered in Kannapolis, North Carolina, United States – 31 mi (50 km) from Charlotte[1] – alongside
        sister team and NASCAR entrant Haas Factory Team, though the two teams are separate entities. The team also established
        a forward base in Banbury, England, to turn cars around between races during the European part of the calendar.[3] The
        team maintains a design office in Maranello, which is also home to Scuderia Ferrari's headquarters.[13]
        
        History
        
        The team's American headquarters in Kannapolis, North Carolina
        Preparations
        Haas was the first American constructor to submit an F1 entry after the failed US F1 project in 2010,[14] and is the
        first American constructor to compete since the unrelated Haas Lola outfit raced in the 1985 and 1986 seasons. The Haas
        Lola team was owned by former McLaren boss Teddy Mayer and Carl Haas, who was not related to Gene Haas.
        
        Following the collapse of Marussia F1 during the 2014 season and the auctioning of their assets, Haas purchased the
        team's Banbury headquarters to serve as a forward base for their operations.[15]
        
        Unrestricted by testing regulations until the time they actually entered Formula One, Haas shook its new car down in
        December 2015 ahead of official pre-season testing at Barcelona in early 2016.[16] Haas approached Italian manufacturer
        Dallara to build their chassis, with a power unit supplied by Ferrari.[3][17] Former Jaguar and Red Bull Racing
        technical director Guenther Steiner was the team principal for 10 years until 2024.[3] Haas confirmed its new car had
        passed the mandatory FIA crash tests in January 2016.[18]New driver line-up of Esteban Ocon and Oliver Bearman announced for 2025.</p>
