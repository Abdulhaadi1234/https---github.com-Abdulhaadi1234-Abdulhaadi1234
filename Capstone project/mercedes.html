        <h1>Mercedes</h1>

        <p>Mercedes-Benz, a German luxury automotive brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved in Formula One as both
        team owner and engine manufacturer for various periods since 1954. The current Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team is based in
        Brackley, England,[5] and holds a German racing licence.[6] An announcement was made in December 2020 that Ineos planned
        to take a one third equal ownership stake alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and Toto Wolff;[7] this came into effect on
        25 January 2022.[8] Mercedes-branded teams are often referred to by the nickname, the "Silver Arrows" (German:
        Silberpfeile).
        
        Before the Second World War, Mercedes-Benz competed in the European Championship, winning three titles. The marque
        debuted in Formula One in 1954. After winning their first race at the 1954 French Grand Prix, driver Juan Manuel Fangio
        won another three Grands Prix to win the 1954 Drivers' Championship and repeated this success in 1955. Despite winning
        two Drivers' Championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor racing after 1955 in response to the 1955 Le Mans
        disaster.
        
        Mercedes returned to Formula One in 1994 as an engine manufacturer in association with Ilmor, a British independent
        high-performance autosport engineering company, which developed their engines. The company won one constructors' title
        and three drivers' titles in a works partnership with McLaren which lasted until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as
        Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains. In 2010, the company bought the Brawn GP team, rebranding it as Mercedes.
        Since a major rule shake-up in 2014, which required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric engines, Mercedes has
        become one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from 2014 to
        2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021, both records. The manufacturer has also collected
        more than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and thirteen
        Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.In 2025, Andrea Kimi Antonelli and George Russell will be the drivers for the Mercedes F1 team. Antonelli, a member of
        the Mercedes Junior Team, will be making his Formula One debut with the team, while Russell is a veteran driver who has
        been with Mercedes since 2022.</p>
