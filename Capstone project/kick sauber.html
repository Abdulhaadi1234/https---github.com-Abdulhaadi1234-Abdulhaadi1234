        <h1>Kick Sauber</h1>

        <p>The Kick Sauber C45 is a Formula One car designed and constructed by Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber to compete in the 2025
        Formula One World Championship. The car is driven by Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hülkenberg in what is the team's final
        year before transforming into the Audi factory team from 2026 onwards.

        Development context
        Sauber unveiled the car's livery at the F1 75 Live event on 18 February 2025.[2] The C45 chassis was later revealed in
        digital renderings immediately following the event.[3] The car has been designed to build on a late-season aerodynamic
        and cooling package brought to the Kick Sauber C44.[3] After experiencing significant stiffness and handling issues
        during pre-season testing, technical director James Key brought forward an upgrade package that was due during the early
        rounds of the season.[4] As a result, the cars that appeared at Albert Park for the first round bore many aerodynamic
        and internal differences to the pre-season version of the car.For the 2025 Formula One season, Kick Sauber's driver lineup will feature Nico Hülkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto. This
        marks a significant change from the previous season's lineup, with Bottas and Zhou Guanyu leaving the team. Bortoleto, a
        rising star in Formula 2, will be making his F1 debut with the team. Hülkenberg, a veteran driver with experience in F1,
        joins the team after a stint with Haas.</p>
