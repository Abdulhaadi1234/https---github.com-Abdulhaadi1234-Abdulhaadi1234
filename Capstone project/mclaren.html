        <p>McLaren Racing Limited (/məˈklærən/ mə-KLARR-ən) is a British motor racing team based at the McLaren Technology Centre
        in Woking, Surrey, England. The team is a subsidiary of the McLaren Group, which owns a majority of the team. McLaren is
        best known as a Formula One chassis constructor, the second-oldest active team and the second-most successful Formula
        One team after Ferrari, having won 194 races, 12 Drivers' Championships, and nine Constructors' Championships. McLaren
        also has a history in American open wheel racing as both an entrant and a chassis constructor, and has won the
        Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am) sports car racing championship. McLaren is one of only three constructors, and
        the only team, to complete the Triple Crown of Motorsport (wins at the Indianapolis 500, 24 Hours of Le Mans, and Monaco
        Grand Prix).
        
        Founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, but
        their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed,
        with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue in 1972 and Johnny Rutherford in 1974 and 1976. After Bruce
        McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer took over and led the team to their first Formula One
        Constructors' Championship in 1974, with Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and
        1976 respectively. The year 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by the Marlboro cigarette brand.
        
        In 1981, McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing; Dennis took over as team principal, and shortly afterwards
        organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most
        successful era; with Porsche and Honda engines, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, and Ayrton Senna won seven Drivers'
        Championships between them and the team took six Constructors' Championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was
        particularly dominant—together they won all but one race in 1988—but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for
        Ferrari. Fellow English team Williams offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every
        constructors' title between 1984 and 1994. By the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to
        Williams, and the team went three seasons without a win. With Mercedes-Benz engines, West sponsorship, and former
        Williams designer Adrian Newey, further championships came in 1998 and 1999 with driver Mika Häkkinen, and during the
        2000s the team were consistent front-runners, with Lewis Hamilton taking their latest drivers' title in 2008.
        
        Ron Dennis retired as McLaren team principal in 2009, handing over to long-time McLaren employee Martin Whitmarsh. At
        the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since 2004, Whitmarsh was ousted. McLaren announced in 2013 that they
        would be using Honda engines from 2015 onwards, replacing Mercedes-Benz.[6] The team raced as McLaren Honda for the
        first time since 1992 at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix. In September 2017, McLaren announced they had agreed on an
        engine supply with Renault from 2018 to 2020. McLaren is using Mercedes-Benz engines from the 2021 season until at least
        2030.[7][8] The team's ninth Constructors' Championship, and first since 1998, was won in 2024. McLaren is the joint
        second-most successful Formula One team of all time with nine Constructors' Championships, a record shared with Williams
        as of the end of the 2024 season.
        
        After initially returning to the Indianapolis 500 in 2017 as a backer of Andretti Autosport to run Fernando Alonso and
        then in 2019 as an independent entry, McLaren announced in August 2019 that they would run in conjunction with Arrow
        Schmidt Peterson Motorsports starting in 2020 to run the full IndyCar Series, the combined entry being named Arrow
        McLaren SP.[9] Initially having no ownership interest in the team, McLaren would purchase 75% of the operation in
        2021.[10] McLaren entered the electric off-road racing series Extreme E from 2022 to 2024,[11] and also joined Formula E
        in the 2022–23 season.[12]McLaren Formula 1 will race with Mercedes-Benz power in the 2025 F1 season, taking to the track for 24 race weekends
        with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.</p>
