        <p>Red Bull Racing, currently competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing and also known simply as Red Bull or RBR, is a Formula
        One racing team, competing under an Austrian racing licence and based in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Formula
        One teams owned by conglomerate Red Bull GmbH, the other being Racing Bulls. The Red Bull Racing team has been managed
        by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.[7]
        
        Red Bull had Cosworth engines in 2005 and Ferrari engines in 2006. The team used engines supplied by Renault between
        2007 and 2018 (from 2016 to 2018, the Renault engine was re-badged TAG Heuer following the breakdown in the relationship
        between Red Bull and Renault in 2015).[8][9] During this partnership, they won four successive Drivers' and
        Constructors' Championship titles in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, becoming the first Austrian team to win the title.[10]
        
        The team began using Honda engines in 2019.[11] The works Honda partnership culminated in 2021, following Red Bull
        driver Max Verstappen's World Drivers' Championship victory, with Verstappen also winning the championship in 2022,
        2023, and 2024. Red Bull also won two Constructors' Championship titles in 2022 and 2023, but lost out in 2021 to
        Mercedes and in 2024 to McLaren. Honda left the sport officially after 2021 but is set to continue to supply complete
        engines from Japan to the team partly under Red Bull Powertrains branding until the end of 2025.[12] Red Bull have a new
        wind tunnel due to be operational by 2026.[13][14]In the 2025 Formula 1 season, Red Bull Racing, competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing, will have a new driver lineup with
        Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson.</p>
