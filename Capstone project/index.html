        <h1>F1</h1>
        <p>Formula One (F1) is the highest class of worldwide racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by
        the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's
        premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of
        motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One
        season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents
        on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.
        
        A points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one
        for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing
        licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for
        tracks.
        
        Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by
        generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as
        underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch
        control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced
        in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.[1]
        
        With the average annual cost of running a team—e.g. designing, building, and maintaining cars; staff payroll;
        transport—at approximately £220 million,[2] Formula One's financial and political battles are widely reported. The
        Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for
        US$8 billion.[3][4]</p>
