        Livery
        All ten teams, including Aston Martin, unveiled their livery on 18 February 2025 at a dedicated event.[2]
        
        At the Chinese Grand Prix, the team paid tribute to Eddie Jordan (the founder of Jordan Grand Prix, the team's
        ancestor), who died right before the race weekend. His name and team logo with a red leaf that represents heart were
        present on the side of the car and a side of the rear wing.The Aston Martin AMR25 is a Formula One racing car designed and developed by the Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team competing
