        <p>Williams Racing, legally known as Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited and competing as Atlassian Williams Racing, is
        a British Formula One team and constructor. It was founded by Frank Williams (1942–2021) and Patrick Head. The team was
        formed in 1977 after Frank Williams's earlier unsuccessful F1 operation, Frank Williams Racing Cars (which later became
        Wolf–Williams Racing in 1976). The team is based in Grove, Oxfordshire, on a 60-acre (24 ha) site.[5]
        
        The team's first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand Prix, where the new team ran a March chassis for Patrick Nève. Williams
        started manufacturing its own cars the following year, and Clay Regazzoni won Williams's first race at the 1979 British
        Grand Prix. At the 1997 British Grand Prix, Jacques Villeneuve scored the team's 100th race victory, making Williams one
        of only five teams in Formula One, alongside Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, and Red Bull Racing to win 100 races. Williams
        won nine Constructors' Championships between 1980 and 1997. This was a record until Ferrari won its tenth championship
        in 2000.
        
        Notable drivers for Williams include: Alan Jones, Keke Rosberg, Nico Rosberg, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, David
        Coulthard, Jenson Button, Juan Pablo Montoya, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Riccardo Patrese, Valtteri
        Bottas, Carlos Reutemann, Mark Webber, Felipe Massa and Jacques Villeneuve. Of these drivers, Jones, Keke Rosberg,
        Mansell, Hill, Piquet, Prost, and Villeneuve won the Drivers' title with the team. Of those who have won the
        championship with Williams, only Jones, Keke Rosberg and Villeneuve defended their title while still with the team; as
        Piquet moved to Lotus after winning the 1987 championship; Mansell left F1 to compete in the CART series after winning
        the 1992 championship, Prost retired after winning the 1993 championship, and Hill moved to Arrows after winning the
        1996 championship. None of Williams's Drivers' Champions went on to win another championship after their success with
        Williams.
        
        Williams have worked with many engine manufacturers, most successfully with Renault, winning five of their nine
        Constructors' titles with the company. Along with Ferrari, McLaren, Benetton and Renault, Williams is one of a group of
        five teams that won every Constructors' Championship between 1979 and 2008 and every Drivers' Championship from 1984 to
        2008. Williams also has business interests beyond Formula One. They have established Williams Advanced Engineering and
        Williams Hybrid Power, who take technology originally developed for Formula One and adapt it for commercial
        applications. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to GKN. In May 2020, Williams announced they were seeking
        buyers for a portion of the team due to poor financial performance in 2019 and that they had terminated the contract of
        title sponsor ROKiT. On 21 August 2020, Williams was acquired by Dorilton Capital. Frank and Claire Williams stepped
        down from being Manager and Deputy Manager of the team on 6 September 2020, with the 2020 Italian Grand Prix being their
        last time in their respective positions.[6]In 2025, Williams Racing will have Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz Jr. as their drivers. This is a new pairing for the team,
        with Sainz joining Albon to form the lineup for the 2025 season.</p>
