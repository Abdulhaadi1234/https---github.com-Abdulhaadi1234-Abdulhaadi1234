        <h1>F1 (Formula One)</h1>
        <p>
            Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel
            single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One
            World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950. The word
            formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a
            series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either
            purpose-built circuits or closed roads.

        <h1>Lewis hamillton</h1>
        <p>
            Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver, currently competing in Formula One
            for Mercedes. Hamilton has won a joint-record seven Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles—tied with Michael
            Schumacher—and holds the records for most wins (105), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (202), among others.
            
            Born and raised in Stevenage, Hamilton began his career in karting aged six, winning several national titles and
            attracting the attention of Ron Dennis, who signed him to the McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme in 1998. After
            winning the direct-drive Karting World Cup and European Championship in 2000, Hamilton progressed to junior formulae,
            where his successes included winning the Formula 3 Euro Series and the GP2 Series. He subsequently signed for McLaren in
            2007, becoming the first black driver to compete in Formula One at the Australian Grand Prix. In his rookie season,
            Hamilton won four Grands Prix and set several records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. Hamilton
            won his maiden title in 2008, making a title-deciding overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season to become
            the then-youngest World Drivers' Champion. The dominant Red Bull-Renault combination prevailed throughout his remaining
            four seasons at McLaren, with Hamilton achieving multiple race wins in each, including his involvement in a four-way
            title battle in 2010.
            
            Hamilton signed for Mercedes in 2013 to partner Nico Rosberg, ending his 15-year association with McLaren. Following his
            maiden victory with the team at the Hungarian Grand Prix, new engine regulations came into effect the following season,
            which saw Mercedes emerge as the dominant force in Formula One. From 2014 to 2016, Hamilton and Rosberg won 51 of 59
            Grands Prix amidst their fierce rivalry—widely known as The Silver War—with Hamilton winning the former titles in 2014
            and 2015, and Rosberg winning the latter. Following Rosberg's retirement, Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point
            deficits to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to claim his fourth and fifth titles in 2017 and 2018. Hamilton won his sixth
            title in 2019, before breaking several records across his 2020 campaign—including the all-time win record at the
            Portuguese Grand Prix—to equal Michael Schumacher's record of seven World Drivers' Championships. Hamilton became the
            first driver to surpass 100 race wins and pole positions in 2021, finishing runner-up to Max Verstappen amidst a
            controversial finish. Following winless campaigns in 2022 and 2023, Hamilton took his record-breaking ninth British
            Grand Prix victory in 2024. After 12 seasons with Mercedes, Hamilton is set to join Ferrari from 2025 onwards.
