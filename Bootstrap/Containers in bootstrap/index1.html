        <h1>F1 (Formula One)</h1>
        <p>
            Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel
            single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA
            Formula One
            World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in
            1950. The word
            formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season
            consists of a
            series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either
            purpose-built circuits or closed roads.

        <h1>GO Karting</h1>
        <p>
Kart racing or karting is a motorsport discipline using open-wheel, four-wheeled vehicles known as go-karts or shifter
karts. They are usually raced on scaled-down circuits, although some professional kart races are also held on full-size
motorsport circuits. Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, with most
Formula One drivers—including Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Räikkönen, Lewis Hamilton,
Sebastian Vettel, Nico Rosberg, and Max Verstappen—having begun their careers in karting.

Karts vary widely in speed, and some (known as superkarts) can reach speeds exceeding 160 kilometres per hour (100 mph),
while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.

History

Kart racing in Illinois in 1962

Kart racing in Berlin, East Germany, 1963
American Art Ingels is generally accepted to be the father of karting. A veteran hot rodder and a race car builder at
Kurtis Kraft, he built the first kart in Southern California in 1956.[1] Early karting events were held in the Rose Bowl
Stadium car park.[2] Instantly popular, Karting rapidly spread to other countries,[3] and currently has a large
following in Europe.

The first kart manufacturer was an American company, Go Kart Manufacturing Co. (1957). In 1959, McCulloch was the first
company to produce engines for karts. Its first engine, the McCulloch MC-10,[4] was an adapted chainsaw two-stroke
engine.[5] Later, in the 1960s, motorcycle engines were also adapted for kart use, before dedicated manufacturers,
especially in Italy (IAME), started to build engines for the sport.
