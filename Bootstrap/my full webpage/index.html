            <h2>Red Bull</h2>
            <p>Red Bull Racing, currently competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing and also known simply as Red Bull or RBR, is a Formula
            One racing team, racing under an Austrian licence and based in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Formula One teams
            owned by conglomerate Red Bull GmbH, the other being RB Formula One Team. The Red Bull Racing team has been managed by
            Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.[8]
            
            Red Bull had Cosworth engines in 2005 and Ferrari engines in 2006. The team used engines supplied by Renault between
            2007 and 2018 (from 2016 to 2018, the Renault engine was re-badged TAG Heuer following the breakdown in the relationship
            between Red Bull and Renault in 2015).[9][10] During this partnership, they won four successive Drivers' and
            Constructors' Championship titles from 2010 to 2013, becoming the first Austrian team to win the title.[11] The team
            began using Honda engines in 2019.[12] The works Honda partnership culminated in 2021 following Red Bull driver Max
            Verstappen's World Drivers' Championship victory, with Verstappen also winning the championship in 2022 and 2023. Honda
            left the sport officially after 2021 but is set to continue to supply complete engines from Japan to the team partly
            under Red Bull Powertrains branding until the end of 2025.[13]
            
            History
            Origins
            See also: Stewart Grand Prix and Jaguar Racing
            The current Red Bull team traces its origins back to the Stewart Grand Prix outfit that made its debut in 1997. Jackie
            Stewart sold his team to the Ford Motor Company late in 1999, and Ford made the decision to rebrand the team Jaguar
            Racing with little subsequent success over the next five years.
            
            
            Red Bull's involvement in Formula One dates back to 1995, when it first sponsored the Sauber team.
            The Jaguar Racing Formula One constructor and racing team was put up for sale in September 2004 when Ford decided it
            could "no longer make a compelling business case for any of its brands to compete in Formula One."[14] Red Bull, an
            energy drinks company, agreed its purchase of Jaguar Racing on the final day of the sale, 15 November 2004.[15] BBC
            Sport reported that Ford asked bidders for a symbolic US$1 in return for a commitment to invest US$400 million in the
            team over three Grand Prix seasons.[15] The team continued to have access to the Cosworth engine developed for their
            2005 chassis, and the operation continued under the new title. Christian Horner was installed as the new team boss and
            lined up David Coulthard and Christian Klien to drive for the team. The team operated under a British racing licence
            from 2005 to 2006.[16]
            
            Red Bull Racing was not the start of Red Bull's involvement in Formula One, as they sponsored Sauber from 1995 to 2004.
            After buying a Formula One team of its own, Red Bull ended its long-term partnership with the Swiss team. Red Bull also
            runs a young drivers programme, Red Bull Junior Team, whereby Red Bull sponsors promising young drivers. High-profile
            drivers who have received this backing include Enrique Bernoldi, Christian Klien, Patrick Friesacher, Vitantonio Liuzzi
            and Scott Speed. Red Bull also sponsors many drivers and teams competing in the Formula 2 Championship, Formula One's
            "feeder" series.</p>

            <h3>Mercedes</h3>
            <p>Mercedes-Benz, a German luxury automotive brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved in Formula One as both
            team owner and engine manufacturer for various periods since 1954. The current Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team is based in
            Brackley, England,[4] and possesses a German licence.[5] An announcement was made in December 2020 that Ineos planned to
            take a one third equal ownership stake alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and Toto Wolff;[6] this came into effect on 25
            January 2022.[7] Mercedes-branded teams are often referred to by the nickname, the "Silver Arrows" (‹See Tfd›German:
            Silberpfeile).
            
            Before the Second World War, Mercedes-Benz competed in the European Championship, winning three titles. The marque
            debuted in Formula One in 1954. After winning their first race at the 1954 French Grand Prix, driver Juan Manuel Fangio
            won another three Grands Prix to win the 1954 Drivers' Championship and repeated this success in 1955. Despite winning
            two Drivers' Championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor racing after 1955 in response to the 1955 Le Mans
            disaster.
            
            Mercedes returned to Formula One in 1994 as an engine manufacturer in association with Ilmor, a British independent
            high-performance autosport engineering company, which developed their engines. The company won one constructors' title
            and three drivers' titles in a works partnership with McLaren which lasted until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as
            Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains. In 2010, the company bought the Brawn GP team, rebranding it as Mercedes.
            Since a major rule shake-up in 2014, which required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric engines, Mercedes has
            become one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from 2014 to
            2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021, both records. The manufacturer has also collected
            more than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and thirteen
            Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.</p>
